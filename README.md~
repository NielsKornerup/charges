charges
=======
This project simulates the movement of charged particles. It can be found on [my website] (http://nielskornerup.github.io/). The algorithm relates the force of magnatism to the square of the distance between the particles. This algorithm is implemented in charge.js. In the future, I want to work on adding style, and making the controls work regaurdless of window size.
