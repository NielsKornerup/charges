charges
=======
This project simulates the movement of charged particles. It can be found on [my website] (http://nielskornerup.github.io/). The algorithm relates the force of magnetism to the square of the distance between the particles. This algorithm is implemented in charge.js. In the future, I want to work on adding style, and making the controls work regardless of window size. Feel free to help. If you want to run this project locally, just clone the git repository and you can run it from index.html. By the way, I suck at writing READMEs, so feel free to edit this and make it better.
